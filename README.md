# Number Guessing

This the most simple project that every new programmer such as I would build.

## How it works

This project will run in terminal only(for now) and there is a simple logic, just guess the word which has been chosen from 1 to 100

**keep in mind : the 1 and 100 are also counted.**

## More About this project

This project was built to practise python in real world by building a simple game.
Also the main idea of this project is because it was one of the project/challenge fo my [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

### Builts

- Python
